## Summary

This is a simple news app. Choose your preferred language for the results and search for news. Hover over a result to see more details, and click to read the full article.  

This branch adds extra functionality to the main app. Using AWS Lambda, Cheer.io, and OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo (or a model of your choice), the app can parse the original article and return a "rephrased" version of the text. It was created exclusively for skill demonstration purposes.  

Please note that the current version of the Lambda function may take some time (~10s) to process your request.
